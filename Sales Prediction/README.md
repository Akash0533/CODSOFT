#task3 #completed :- Sales Prediction on a retail company Project for My Internship at CodSoft. 

ABOUT:-
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize their sales potential.

#Here are some of the specific steps involved in the project :-
1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Load the data.
3. Split the data into a training set and a test set.
4. Fit a linear regression model to the training set.
5. Make predictions on the test set.
6. Evaluate the model's performance.

#The following are the key findings of the project:-
The coefficient of the TV advertising variable is positive, which indicates that there is a positive linear relationship between TV advertising and sales. The R-squared value of 0.682 indicates that 68.2% of the variation in sales can be explained by the amount of TV advertising. The RMSE value of 14.33 indicates that the model is not perfect, but it is still a good predictor of sales.


CONCLUSION:-
The conclusion we get after predicting is that there is a positive linear relationship between TV advertising and sales. This means that as the amount of TV advertising increases, sales tend to increase as well. The R-squared value of 0.682 indicates that 68.2% of the variation in sales can be explained by the amount of TV advertising.
Overall, the programming results suggest that TV advertising is a significant factor that can be used to predict sales. However, it is important to note that other factors, such as the price of the product, the competition, and the economic climate, can also affect sales.
