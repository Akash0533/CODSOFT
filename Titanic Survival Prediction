#task2 #completed : - TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION Project for My Internship at CodSoft .

The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a machine learning project that uses historical data about the Titanic disaster to predict whether a passenger would survive. The data includes information about the passenger's sex, age, class, fare, and whether they were traveling with family.
The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to train a model that can predict survival. The most common algorithms used for this project are logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
The accuracy of the model depends on the quality of the data and the complexity of the model. In general, more complex models can achieve higher accuracy, but they are also more likely to overfit the data.
Here are some of the specific steps involved in the project :-
1.	Data preprocessing: This involves cleaning the data and removing any missing values.
2.	Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from the existing features.
3.	Model training: This involves training a machine learning model on the data.
4.	Model evaluation: This involves evaluating the performance of the model on a test set.
5.	Model deployment: This involves deploying the model in a production environment.
