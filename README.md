Task 1: IRIS Flower Classification Project for My Internship at CodSoft


I have used various steps to classify the IRIS Flower. Some are described as follows:-

1.Import Library 
2.Read DataSet
3.Analyses
4. Defining X & Y
5. Splitting X and Y in Train dataset & Test dataset.
6.Import Algorithm/Model.
7.Train Model.
8. Prediciton through model
9. Evaluation.
10.Confusion Matrix.
11.Classification report 
12. Accuracy score CLASSIFICATION

The #irisflowerclassification #project is a popular #machinelearning project that involves classifying three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The project can be implemented using a variety of machine learning #algorithms, such as #logisticregression, #decisiontree, and #svm.

The project is a good way to learn about the basics of machine learning, and it can also be used to explore other machine learning algorithms.
